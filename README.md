This is an **Undergraduate Project** that manages sort of a hospital management system and Interaction between Doctor and Patient done
(I was learning Django then)

Integrates with the **SanitasBot_RASA** chatbot for custom patient queries about first aid

This was done just as a mockup as a vision for future hospital system integration upon further development of good LLMs.
(**Longform** for "when the LLMs stop hallucinating lmao").

Doctor can manage their patients,
Patients can receive notification about recomendations from Doctors and More.
Admin can add confirm both Doctors and Patients.
